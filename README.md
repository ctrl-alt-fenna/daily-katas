# Daily Katas
Katas are small educational (in my case, programming) challenges. During the Experis Academy I was given a new Kata every single morning. This repository contains all my submissions. If you wish to try the challenges yourself, check out the links below for each challenge.

# Testing/Usage
To run testcases:
```
npm test [path(optional)]
```
If you don't specify a path, it will automatically run all the kata-testcases. 
The tests are run using jest, so make sure you have installed all the packages:
```
npm install
```
